Running create_co2_footprint_estimator.sh will train and run a simple app that would provide the information regarding 
the carbon footprint that the user would be leaving behind when carrying out a task. The input will be raw text and it will be
the task the user is going to perform. The Transformer model would then identify the entities inside the task input by the user
to provide them with the information of carbon footprint that particular activity would be creating.
